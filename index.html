        <h1>The Light Web</h1>
        <h2>What is the Light Web?</h2>
        <p>
            The Light Web is a philosophy, a synthesis of ideas that have resonated with me recently, aimed at creating websites that live up to the ideals of the early web. The early years of the World Wide Web were filled with whimsy and optimism. There was so much potential in this new medium, and so many people excited to explore that potential. But halfway through the third decade of the 21<sup>st</sup> Century, the web has suffered from the same late-stage capitalist degradation that so much of society has. The Light Web is a movement to recapture the idealistic, humanistic promise of the web in its infancy.

            The term "The Light Web" came to me late at night in a sort of "the Dark Web implies the existence of the Light Web" sort of way, but the Light Web does not stand in opposition to the Dark Web. In fact, the Light Web philosophy is fully in favor of the sort of privacy and anonymity afforded by tools like <a href="https://www.torproject.org">TOR</a>. The darkness that the Light Web opposes is that of <a href="https://www.deceptive.design">dark patterns</a>&mdash;<q cite="https://www.deceptive.design">tricks used&hellip;[to] make you do things that you didn't mean to</q>&mdash;and other user-hostile designs like third party trackers, ad-blocker blockers, and nagging popover windows.

        <h3>Light as in Light as a Feather</h3>
        <p>
            Internet connection speeds that are considered intolerably slow today would have been incomprehensibly fast at the dawn of the web. My own internet connection today is roughly 50,000 times faster than the modem I first used to connect to the internet. With that multiplier, a site that takes 10 seconds to load for me now might have taken five and a half <em>days</em> on that old 9,600 bit/s dial-up modem. Modern broadband speeds have allowed modern websites to grow bloated and inefficient. The Light Web philosophy in no way suggests that websites should abandon multimedia content or return to the postage stamp sized images of yore. Instead, it espouses the idea that the weight of a page should be reserved for its <em>content</em>.
